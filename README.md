# Panoramic-Image-Stitching-using-invariant-features

I have created Panoramic image using invariant feature and also it takes unordered images and find the actual scenes. I have basically imlemented the David Lowe paper on Automatic Image stitching using Invariants features. 

After running the code you will find the images like in panaroma_image. Matched_points is showing the valid matches in images.
In order to run the code you should run the program stitch.py.
